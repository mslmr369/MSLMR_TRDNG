# MSLMR_TRDNG: Advanced Algorithmic Trading System

## Descripción

**MSLMR_TRDNG** is a sophisticated algorithmic trading system designed for cryptocurrency markets. It supports both traditional technical analysis-based strategies and advanced machine learning models to generate trading signals. The system features robust backtesting capabilities, live trading execution, risk management, performance monitoring with an interactive dashboard, and real-time alerts.

## Key Features

*   **Modular Design:** Built with a modular architecture for easy extension and maintenance. Each component (data ingestion, preprocessing, strategies, models, etc.) is designed to be independent and easily replaceable.
*   **Multiple Trading Strategies:**
    *   **Traditional Strategies:**
        *   RSI-MACD Strategy: Combines Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators.
        *   Moving Average Crossover Strategy: Generates signals based on the crossover of short and long moving averages. Supports simple, exponential, and weighted moving averages.
    *   **Machine Learning Models:**
        *   Time Series Forecasting: Predicts future price movements using LSTM, GRU, or Transformer models.
        *   Market Classification: Classifies the next price movement as up or down using Dense or LSTM networks.
*   **Advanced Backtesting:**
    *   Simulates realistic trading conditions, including commission rates and slippage.
    *   Calculates comprehensive performance metrics (total trades, win rate, total profit, average profit, max drawdown, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio).
    *   Allows for backtesting multiple strategies across various symbols and timeframes.
*   **Live Trading Execution:**
    *   Connects to cryptocurrency exchanges via the `ccxt` library (supports numerous exchanges).
    *   Executes trades based on generated signals in real-time.
    *   Supports dry-run mode for simulated trading without using real capital.
*   **Robust Risk Management:**
    *   Calculates position size dynamically based on account balance, risk per trade, and stop-loss levels.
    *   Implements dynamic stop-loss using Average True Range (ATR).
    *   Includes trailing stop-loss functionality to protect profits.
    *   Validates trades against maximum single trade risk and overall portfolio risk limits.
    *   Analyzes portfolio concentration and provides alerts if it exceeds a defined threshold.
    *   Performs Monte Carlo simulations to estimate potential drawdowns.
*   **Performance Monitoring and Analytics:**
    *   Calculates and tracks key performance metrics (total trades, win rate, profit/loss, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, etc.).
    *   Generates detailed performance reports in JSON format.
*   **Interactive Dashboard:**
    *   Visualizes trading performance with interactive charts and tables using `Flask` and `Plotly`.
    *   Displays real-time updates of latest signals, trades, and alerts through AJAX.
    *   Provides an overview of backtesting results.
    *   Implements user authentication for security.
*   **Real-Time Alerts:**
    *   Sends alerts via Telegram and email on trade executions and system errors.
    *   Supports adding more notification channels through an `AlertChannel` interface.
    *   Stores alerts in the database for later review.
*   **Database Integration:**
    *   Uses PostgreSQL to store market data, indicators, signals, trades, and backtest results.
    *   Employs SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions.
*   **Caching:**
    *   Implements a distributed cache using Redis to store market data and calculation results, improving performance.
    *   Provides a `CacheDecorator` and a `CacheFactory` for flexible cache management.
*   **Logging:**
    *   Comprehensive structured logging using `structlog` and `pythonjsonlogger` to output logs in JSON format for easy analysis.
    *   Includes `LoggingMixin` and `log_method` decorator for convenient logging in classes and methods.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Centralized configuration management using a `ConfigManager` class.
    *   Supports different configuration files for development and production environments.
    *   Loads sensitive information from environment variables.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:**
    *   Utilizes `asyncio` and `aiohttp` for asynchronous data fetching and trade execution in live trading mode, improving responsiveness.
*   **Extensible:**
    *   Easily add new strategies by inheriting from the `BaseStrategy` class.
    *   Add new machine learning models by inheriting from the `BaseModel` class.
    *   Extend with new data sources, exchanges, and alert channels.

```
## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd MSLMR_TRDNG
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
    venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Configuration

1. **Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory or copy and rename the provided `.env.example`.
    *   Fill in the necessary values for database connection, exchange API keys, Telegram bot token, email settings, and other configuration parameters as explained in the `.env.example` file.

2. **Configuration Files:**
    *   The `config/` directory contains configuration files for different environments (base, development, production).
    *   Modify the settings in these files according to your needs. You can create an additional `testing` configuration if needed.

## Database Setup

The system uses PostgreSQL as its database backend.

1. **Install PostgreSQL:** Follow the instructions for your operating system to install PostgreSQL (version 12 or higher is recommended).
2. **Create Database and User:**
    *   Create a new database (e.g., `trading_db`).
    *   Create a new user (e.g., `trading_user`) with a secure password.
    *   Grant all privileges on the database to the new user.

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE trading_db;
    CREATE USER trading_user WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'your_password';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE trading_db TO trading_user;
    ```

3. **Database Initialization:**
    *   Run `python init_db.py` to create the necessary tables in the database. This script uses the SQLAlchemy models defined in `data/models.py`.

## Usage

### Running the Live Trading System

To start the live trading system, run:

```bash
python main.py
```
```
This will:

1. Initialize the necessary components (configuration, logging, database, strategies, models, etc.).
2. Start the live trading system, which will continuously fetch market data, generate signals, execute trades (in `dry_run` mode if enabled), and monitor performance.

**Note:**

*   Ensure that you have configured the `.env` file with your exchange API keys and other settings.
*   You can use the `--dry-run` argument to simulate trading without executing real orders.

### Accessing the Dashboard

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:8000` (or the configured host and port). You'll need to log in with the configured credentials (currently a placeholder in the code - you need to implement a proper authentication mechanism).

### Backtesting

To run backtests, use the `run_backtests.py` script:

```bash
python scripts/run_backtests.py --start-date 2022-01-01 --end-date 2023-01-01
```
```
This will:

1. Run backtests for all registered strategies using the specified date range.
2. Generate performance reports (in JSON format) and an HTML dashboard in the `backtest_results` directory.

You can customize the `start-date`, `end-date`, and other backtesting parameters in the script or through command-line arguments.

### Model Training

To train machine learning models, use the `train_models.py` script:

```bash
python scripts/train_models.py --model-type forecasting --nn-type lstm --epochs 20
```

```
This will:

1. Train a TimeSeriesForecaster model of type 'lstm' for 20 epochs.
2. Save the trained model in the `trained_models/` directory.

You can adjust the `model-type`, `nn-type`, `epochs`, and other parameters using command-line arguments.

## Further Development

The `brainstorm_proyect` directory contains further brainstorming ideas and a roadmap for future development, including:

*   Integration with advanced models (CNNs, Transformers, GPTs).
*   Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for strategy optimization.
*   Reinforcement Learning (RL) for strategy learning.
*   Meta-learning for adaptation to changing market conditions.
*   High-frequency trading (HFT) capabilities.
*   More sophisticated risk management techniques.
*   Security enhancements (secrets management, authentication, etc.)
*   More tests
